Notes and plans for the different bits and bobs in this sandbox

Node Editor
===========
High-level view:
----------------
Visual node editor in the realm of Illumination software Creator or Blender's node editor

Reasons for working on this:
----------------------------
I wanted to do something similar to Illumination Software Creator which has multiple input and output points for each node, unlike ISC. 

Goal:
-----
make the visual representation go to code/visual/audio result

Some Noodling
-------------
node input
node output
node operation
node type
node encapsulation


[type,[input 1, input 2],[output 1], name]

var x = 5 = ["var",[5],[],"x"]

def func (x=5)
	for a in range x
	print a

["def",[x],[],"func"]

["def",[x],[y],"funcwithreturn]

List of nodes and connections
actual states based on changes to nodes

add node
remove node
connect node
disconnect node
Move Node
Add Connector
remove connector
move connector
connect connect
disconnect connector

to draw a node I need a little math done in order to ensure that it is the proper size and everything is in place.
Text: 16 pixels
border: 2 pixels
attach circle: 4 pixels

Quick and Dirty Pseudocode
--------------------------
Load window
	set window size
	set window title
	set graphical context (tk, opengl, sdl, whatever)
	load media
        draw buttons
	draw canvas
	get initial state information
	test if opening file or new file
	test if opening medium or new medium
manipulate nodes
	add nodes
	remove nodes and any connectors
	connect nodes with connectors
	disconnect nodes from connectors
	move nodes and any connectors
	focus on node
	update node info
detect node changes and make appropriate changes to medium (code/image/audio)
	test node connectivity
	test node info changes
	test output view position among nodes
	run through changes of each node on medium
	update output viewer of changes at it's position
save node configuration
	get node connections
	get node info
	get node positions
	calculate best zoom
	open and save all above info (yaml?)
save changes to medium
	calculate changes made 
	make changes
	save medium
update window
	click mouse(select, focus)
	drag mouse(pan)
	zoom in
	zoom out
	keyboard input(shortcuts/text input)
close program
	make sure file is saved
	do not save the medium
	if necessary, delete all objects in memory
	close program
